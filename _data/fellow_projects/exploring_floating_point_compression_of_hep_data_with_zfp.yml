title: "**Exploring Floating Point Compression of HEP data with zfp**"
description: "Streams of floating point data representing observed or simulated data is notoriously difficult to compress.  Compression algorithms often work by looking for repetition of data within a bytestream.  Floating point data, however, often contains additional noise beyond the accuracy of the underlying instrument or simulation; this removes sources of repetitive data.  By accepting data loss beyond a certain threshold - and taking advantage of the known structure of floating point representations - floating point compression libraries, such as [zfp](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/floating-point-compression), can manipulate the floating point values to make them highly compressible.  Some HEP data formats like CMSâ€™s MiniAOD format already utilize rudimentary techniques (e.g., zeroing out the mantissa) to make data more compressible when the accuracy of the input data is known.  We seek a fellow interested in taking data samples from CMS MiniAOD and compare the performance (CPU cost, compression ratios, memory) of zfp compared to these existing techniques.  By the end of the project, we aim to characterize the potential space savings in MiniAOD from using these libraries and have a prototype version of a MiniAOD file that is zfp-compressed."
